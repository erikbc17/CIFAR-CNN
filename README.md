Non linear activation functions in CIFAR trained CNN for class 10 classifier
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are intricate designs that enable the efficient development of models for image classification. CNNs have provide a powerful framework for understanding images. These models are meticulously designed for processing visual data.
  
  The key architectural components of a CNN include convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions. Convolutional layers are responsible for feature extraction, detecting patterns in images. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions and enhance invariance to translations. Fully connected layers make predictions, and activation functions introduce non-linearity to those predictions. This design enables CNNs to automatically learn features from images through associated learning in ensemble networks.

  In Phase 1 of this project, the primary goal is to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The initial design includes a series of convolutional layers, followed by a few fully connected layers.
  CNN is built to process images categorized into 10 distinct classes. During this phase, we are establishing the architecture, and setting up the loss function & optimizer. The design extracts feature from the input images and lays the groundwork convolutional layers for learning outputs.
